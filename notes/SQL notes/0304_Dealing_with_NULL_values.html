Dealing with NULL values
</p>

<pre class="lpre">

NULLs are a unique concept.

It terms of data in a table, a column value is NULL
if it has no value whatsoever.

For example you might have an EMPLOYEE table and need
to add information for a new employee.  This employee
just moved to the area and is temporarily living in
a hotel.  For now, the employee has no address.

You still want to add the employee to your database so
you add all the information you do have and add no
data for the employee's address.

<hr>

NULLs are different from "blanks" or spaces.  They
are no value at all.   The database assigns the NULL
value to every data column that has not had any
information entered in it.

SQL allows you to search for columns that may have
a NULL value.

Why would that ever be useful?

<hr>

In the above example, about the employee with no
address, we may need to mail the employee a W-2 form
for tax withholding purposes.  You could query
the table for anyone who does not yet have an
address in the system and go talk to those employees
to see if they have gotten a mailing address.

Conceptual Example:

	SELECT lastname, firstname, phone
	FROM employee
	WHERE address IS NULL
	ORDER BY lastname, firstname;

<hr>
NULL means missing, unknown, or not applicable.

It does not mean blank or zero.

Look at the data in the <b>book</b> table.  There is
one book, "Treats and More Treats" that has an advance
of zero.   The publishing company intended to give this
author no money for an advance.  A zero is not a
default value, it is a specific value.  It is not a NULL.

Another book, "The Psychology of Social Networking",
has an advance column whose value is NULL.  This could
mean that the company is going to publish the book
but they have not negotiated a final price for the
book.   They will update this column with a number
when they have finished the negotiations.


<hr>
To find the books that have a NULL in the
advance column you use a statement like this...

  SELECT title
  FROM book
  WHERE advance IS NULL;

To find the books that DO NOT have a NULL in the
advance column you use a statement like this...

  SELECT title
  FROM book
  WHERE advance IS NOT NULL;



<hr>
If you specify criteria about a column that may
have a NULL in it, the rows with the NULL are
automatically not returned to the Result Set.

For example, the title table has 17 rows of data.
One of those rows has a NULL in the advance column.

If you run this statement...

    SELECT title, advance
    FROM book
    WHERE advance >= 0;



<hr>

... you only get 16 rows returned.  When SQL
compared advance to see if was greater than or
equal to zero, NULL values do not pass that
test... thus one row was rejected.

Since a NULL value is "no value" it is never equal to
anything... not even another NULL.   A NULL can only
be directly "found" by SQL using the IS NULL operation.

<hr>

NEVER do this...

    SELECT title, advance
    FROM book
    WHERE advance = NULL;

or this...

    SELECT title, advance
    FROM book
    WHERE advance = 'NULL';

A NULL is never equal to any other value.  Use
the IS NULL or IS NOT NULL instead.
