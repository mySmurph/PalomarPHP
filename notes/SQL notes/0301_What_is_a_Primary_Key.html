What is a Primary Key?
</p>

<pre class="lpre">

A Primary Key is a column, or combination of columns, that
is used to ensure the uniqueness of a row in a table.

All columns in a Primary Key must have a value.

Sometimes a Primary Key may come from "natural"
data, such as the ISBN number in the <b>Book</b> table

The Database Diagram contains new table, <b>Author</b>,
which has an "artificial" Primary Key of author_id

Sometimes an numeric artificial key is used as a
Primary Key even when a natural key exists.


Look at the Database Diagram.

<hr>

A Primary Key, along with a column name, is all that
is needed to retrieve a specific cell of data from a
specific row.
