SQL is a declarative language.  Unlike a programming
language, where you might specify the order of the
logical steps to be taken to achieve a result, SQL
takes care of that for you.

If you ask a question in the right way and with the
right syntax, SQL will deal with any logic needed to
satisfy the request.

As your SELECT statements get more complicated, however,
it is a good idea to have some understanding of the
way (and in what order) SQL processes your statement.

Let's analyze the following statement:

  SELECT name, title, price, advance
  FROM publisher JOIN book USING (pub_id)
  WHERE price > 10 AND advance > 10000
  ORDER BY 1, 2;


First, SQL joins the tables and stores the results
in a temporary, hidden Result Set.

Next, SQL looks at each row individually and applies the
conditions of the WHERE clause to the rows to the hidden
Result Set to make a new hidden Result Set.

Next it applies the SORT criteria to the new hidden Result Set.

Lastly, it keeps the columns listed in the SELECT list and
presents the results.
