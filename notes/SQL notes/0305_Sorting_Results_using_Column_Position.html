Sorting Results using Column Position
</p>

<pre class="lpre">
You already know that you can sort the Result Set in order
by column name using the <b>ORDER BY</b> clause.

You can also use a number that represents the position
where the column (or expression) is found in the SELECT
list.


Example...

  SELECT title, price
  FROM book
  WHERE price > 20
  ORDER BY 1;


This shows the title and price information for all rows
and the results are sorted in title order... because
title is in the first position.

<hr>

You can use the DESC with the number position, just
as you did with a column name.

Example:

  SELECT title, price
  FROM book
  WHERE price > 20
  ORDER BY 1 DESC;

<hr>

You can still have one sort within another sort
by specifying more than one column position.

Example...

  SELECT type, price
  FROM book
  ORDER BY 1, 2;



<hr>

WARNING:

Most SQL statements are eventually incorporated into
a programming language such as PHP, Visual Basic, or PL/SQL.

Using column position numbers for sorting is fine for
working interactively with SQL (as you are doing in this class),
but should not be used if the SQL is intending to be used
with a programming language.   Doing so makes the program
harder to maintain and makes it more likely that errors
will be introduced if the selection criteria change in
the future.
