Aggregate Functions
</p>

<pre class="lpre">

Thus far, you have used SELECT statements that have
shown detailed results.   The Result Set always includes
the rows that pass any criteria test that is specified.

What about summary information?

You want to know the average price of a book for the
Sunshine Publishing company or the total number of books
sold.

Fortunately, SQL provides some standard "aggregate"
functions to allow you to see some summary information.

<hr>

SQL has six standard summary (i.e. aggregate) functions:

  SUM(column_name)		- Totals the values in specified column
  						  for all rows in the Result Set

  AVG(column_name)		- Averages the values in specified column
  						  for all rows in the Result Set

  MIN(column_name)		- Returns the minimum value found in the
                          			  column for all rows in the Result Set

  MAX(column_name)		- Returns the maximum value found in the
                          			  column for all rows in the Result Set

  COUNT(column_name)		- Returns a count of all rows that have a
  						  non-null value in the column-name

  COUNT(*)				- Returns a count of all rows in
  						  the Result Set

<hr>
In all aggregate functions where a column name is specified, NULL
values are ignored.

For example, an AVG function will correctly calculate the average
for all rows in the Result Set by excluding any row from the Result Set
and have a NULL value in the column.

I am using the term, Result Set, loosely here.  When you use an
aggregate function you never see the detailed Result Set displayed.
Instead, the detailed Result Set is used by SQL, internally, to
calculate the result of the aggregate function.

The Results you see are just the summary information.

<br>
The aggregate functions I have showed you here are part of the SQL
specification.


<hr>

WARNING:  You can NOT mix detailed row results and aggregate functions
in a single SELECT statement!

This will NOT work:

	SELECT title, avg(price)
	FROM book;

Unfortunately, in MySQL, it will run... it justs brings back
inaccurate results!


<hr>
Something to Remember...

	When you use an aggregate function in the SELECT list
	you will always get exactly ONE ROW returned.

This will always be true when you are summarizing the information
in the whole table.

We will see in a later chapter, that are ways to summarize
information on subsets of rows... stay tuned.
