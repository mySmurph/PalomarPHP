Join Multiple Tables with the ON clause
</p>

<pre class="lpre">

I almost always use the USING clause since I am looking for equality
on columns that have the same name.  We need to use the ON clause
when the column names are different... or if you need to JOIN on a
compound condition...

	SELECT ssn, a.city, a.state
	FROM author a
	  JOIN publisher p
			ON (a.city = p.city AND a.state = p.state )
	ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;

Another Example:  Say your company had just acquired another
publishing company and now had two "author" tables... author1
and author2.   You need to look for duplicate names.

Conceptual Example...

	SELECT lastname, firstname
	FROM author1 a1 JOIN author2 a2
	  ON (a1.lastname = a2.lastname AND a1.firstname = a2.firstname)
	ORDER BY 1, 2;


<hr>
I'm going to use a slightly altered database to illustrate the use
of the ON clause in joining multiple tables

Imagine, if you will, that we have a zpublisher table instead
of a publisher table.  It has the same columns as the publisher table
except that the Primary Key is publisher_id instead of pub_id.

Also, imagine that we have zauthor table instead of an
author table.  It has the same columns as the author table
except that the Primary Key is the SSN instead of author_id.

The bookauthor table is now the zbookauthor table. It has the same
columns as the bookauthor table but the author_id holds a
SSN instead of a numeric id.

The book table is the same.

Example:

	SELECT title, lastname, firstname
	FROM book
		JOIN zbookauthor USING (ISBN)
		JOIN zauthor ON (author_id = SSN)
	ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;


<hr>
Example:

	SELECT name,  title, lastname, firstname
	FROM zpublisher
		JOIN zbook ON (publisher_id = pub_id)
		JOIN zbookauthor USING (ISBN)
		JOIN zauthor ON (author_id = SSN)
	WHERE name = 'All Techo Books'
	ORDER BY 1, 2, 3, 4;
