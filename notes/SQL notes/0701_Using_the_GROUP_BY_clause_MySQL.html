Using the GROUP BY clause
</p>

<pre class="lpre">
So far, all of the summary information you've seen has
come from using aggregate functions that were processed
using all the rows in a table (or Result Set)

Suppose you wanted to see how many books were sold for all
the books in the database?   You would do...

  SELECT SUM(ytd_sales)
  FROM book;


Now suppose you wanted to see how many books were sold for all
the books in the database but shown by each publisher?

<hr>

The GROUP BY clause allows you to break up SQL results into
sets of data.   You can get summary information on each set.

Example:

  SELECT name, SUM(ytd_sales)
  FROM book JOIN publisher USING (pub_id)
  GROUP BY name
  ORDER BY 1;


Behind the scenes, SQL makes a separate set of data for each
publisher's name and applies the SUM(ytd_sales) to each
separate set.

NOTE:  Now that I can have more than one row returned, I sorted
the results.

<hr>

I know what you're saying, you're saying "But Steve, I thought
you couldn't mix detail information (e.g. name) with summary
information (e.g. SUM(ytd_sales) ).

Well that's still true, if you are summarizing information for the
whole table.  When you use GROUP BY, the column (or columns) you
use to define the subsets may be listed.  In fact, if you leave
them off the SELECT list, how would you know what data went with
what publisher?   The GROUP BY list of columns needs to be
in the SELECT list columns for clarity.

<hr>
Here I am getting the average price of a book based on what type
of book it is...


  SELECT type, AVG(price)
  FROM book
  GROUP BY type
  ORDER BY 1, 2;


Let's get rid of the NULL group...

  SELECT type, AVG(price)
  FROM book
  WHERE price IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY type
  ORDER BY 1, 2;

<hr>

If you use a WHERE clause it must come before the
GROUP BY.

The WHERE clause gets applied first, then the remaining
rows are GROUPed.


<hr>

Let's look at a mistake...

  SELECT type, price, AVG(price)
  FROM book
  WHERE price IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY type
  ORDER BY 1, 2;


Even though this statement runs, it is a mistake!

Unfortunately, MySQL does not show an error but, instead, gives
inaccurate results for the price column.

Look at the price column result for the 'Business' type books.
It says that they are $29.99.   Well, they're not.  

Run this query...

  SELECT type, price
  FROM book
  WHERE type = 'business'
  ORDER BY 1, 2;
  
... and you will see that there are different prices shown
for different books.

MySQL should display an error message instead of running this
statement.  When using a GROUP BY, you must be very careful to 
not list non-aggregated column names in the SELECT list
unless they also appear in the GROUP BY list!

In other words, if you use a GROUP BY, do NOT list any column in the SELECT list
unless it is in the GROUP BY list or inside an aggregate function!

<hr>

Could you use a GROUP BY without using an aggregate function?

Yes.  The GROUP BY clause works like a DISTINCT.

Examples...

  SELECT type
  FROM book
  GROUP BY type
  ORDER BY 1;

... produces the same results as ...

  SELECT DISTINCT type
  FROM book
  ORDER BY 1;
