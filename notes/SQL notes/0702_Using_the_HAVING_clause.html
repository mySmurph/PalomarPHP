Using the HAVING clause
</p>

<pre class="lpre">
You have learned that the WHERE clause is used to restrict
the number of rows that will appear in the Result Set.

The HAVING clause is used to restrict the number of <b>groups</b>
that will appear in the Result Set.


<hr>
Here I am getting the average price of a book based on what type
of book it is...


  SELECT type, AVG(price)
  FROM book
  GROUP BY type
  ORDER BY 1, 2;


Let's just look for where the average price is more
than $25...

  SELECT type, AVG(price)
  FROM book
  GROUP BY type
  HAVING AVG(price) > 25
  ORDER BY 1, 2;


Notice that NULL group goes away as well.

<hr>

If you use a HAVING clause it must come directly after the
GROUP BY clause.

The GROUP BY clause gets applied first, then the groups are
eliminated using the criteria specified in the HAVING clause.

Notice that I used an aggregate in the HAVING clause...
which is the most likely thing you will do with a HAVING clause.

You may never use an aggregate in the WHERE clause!

<hr>

Let's looks at a mistake, so you can see the error message...

  SELECT type, AVG(price)
  FROM book
  WHERE AVG(price) > 25
  GROUP BY type
  ORDER BY 1, 2;


Oracle shows:  <span style="color: red;">ORA-00934: group function is not allowed here</span>

MySQL shows:  <span style="color: red;">MySQL-1111: Invalid use of group function</span>

<hr>

Could you use a HAVING without using an aggregate function?

Yes, but...  The GROUP BY clause will work like a WHERE clause.

  SELECT type
  FROM book
  GROUP BY type
  HAVING type = 'computer'
  ORDER BY 1;

... produces the same number of as ...

  SELECT title, type
  FROM book
  WHERE type = 'computer'
  ORDER BY 1;

... but you can not list the title (or any other column)
than the type column with the first statement.
