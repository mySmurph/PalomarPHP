Logical Operators
</p>

<pre class="lpre">
Logical operators deal with criteria being
specified on multiple columns.

For example, I might be looking for an author
whose last name is Hunter and first name is Cindy.

The "AND" is a logical operator in this case.  It implies
that all conditions must be true in order for a row to
be returned to a Result Set.

Example:

	SELECT lastname, firstname, city, state
	FROM author
	WHERE lastname = 'Hunter' AND firstname = 'Cindy';

<hr>

Another often used logical operator is the "OR".
It implies that at least one of the conditions specified
must be true in order for a row to be returned to a Result Set.

I might want to see all the authors who live in either California
or Utah.

	SELECT lastname, firstname, city, state
	FROM author
	WHERE state = 'CA' OR state = 'UT';


WARNING:  Some one may have asked for this information
in the following way:  "Show me all the authors in California
and Utah."

Even though the person used the word "and" you really
need to use a "OR" to get them all rows with both
California and Utah listed.

<hr>

The last logical operator is:  NOT

It negates any condition found directly after it.
For example, if I wanted to see any author as long
as the did not live in California or Utah, I could first
find all the authors that did live in California or Utah
and negate those results with a NOT operator

Example:

	SELECT lastname, firstname, city, state
	FROM author
	WHERE NOT (state = 'CA' OR state = 'UT');


The ( )'s are important here!

This first finds all rows for authors that live in either
California or Utah, then it "switches" the results to
be all the rows that did NOT meet that criteria of
living in California or Utah.


<hr>
WARNING!

Do not mix NOT's and OR's in the following manner...

	SELECT lastname, firstname, city, state
	FROM author
	WHERE NOT state = 'CA' OR NOT state = 'UT';


Equivalent Statement ( and still bad! ):

	SELECT lastname, firstname, city, state
	FROM author
	WHERE  state != 'CA' OR  state != 'UT';
