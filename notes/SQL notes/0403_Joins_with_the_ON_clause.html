Joins with the ON clause
</p>

<pre class="lpre">
The USING clause allowed you to look equal values
where the column names were named the same...

  SELECT name, title
  FROM publisher JOIN book USING (pub_id)
  ORDER BY 1, 2;


The "long" way to ask the same question using
the ON clause instead of the USING clause...

  SELECT name, title
  FROM publisher JOIN book
    ON (publisher.pub_id = book.pub_id)
  ORDER BY 1, 2;

... but it makes sense to use the USING instead.

<hr>

What do you do when the data you wish
to match is in different column names?

For example, if the <b>pub_id</b> on the publisher
table had a longer name, e.g. publisher_id, you
would then be required to use the ON clause...

  SELECT name, title
  FROM publisher JOIN book
    ON (publisher_id = pub_id)
  ORDER BY 1, 2;

I did not have to qualify the "id" columns with
the table name since they did not have the same name.


<hr>

Look at this statement again...

  SELECT name, title
  FROM publisher JOIN book
    ON (publisher.pub_id = book.pub_id)
  ORDER BY 1, 2;

It is a hassle to have to type out table names
in the ON clause.  The hassle gets greater as you
use more table names.

Fortunately SQL provides a shortcut...


<hr>
<b>Table Aliases</b>

In the FROM clause you can assign shortcuts (i.e. aliases)
to use for table names in the other part of the SELECT
statement.

  SELECT p.name, b.title
  FROM publisher p JOIN book b
    ON (p.pub_id = b.pub_id)
  ORDER BY 1, 2;

Notice that I skip a space after each table name
and specify an abbreviation for each table.  I use
that abbreviation in all other parts of the SELECT
statement... even in the SELECT list.

NOTE:  I did not have to qualify the column names in
the SELECT list here, but I am allowed to.
