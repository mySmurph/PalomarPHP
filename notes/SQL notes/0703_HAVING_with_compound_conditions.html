HAVING with Compound Conditions
</p>

<pre class="lpre">
You can use compound conditions with the  HAVING clause
just as you did with the WHERE clause.

EXAMPLE...

	SELECT type, AVG(price), SUM(ytd_sales)
	FROM book
	GROUP BY type
	HAVING AVG(price) > 25
		AND SUM(ytd_sales) > 20000
	ORDER BY 1, 2;

<hr>

This works even when you use a multiple column group...


	SELECT type, price, AVG(price), SUM(ytd_sales)
	FROM book
	GROUP BY type, price
	HAVING AVG(price) > 10
		AND SUM(ytd_sales) > 5000
	ORDER BY 1, 2;




- END -
