Using Mathematical and Text Expressions
</p>

<pre class="lpre">
You can specify more than just columns in a
SELECT list.

You can involve the columns in mathematical
expressions and you can add extra text information
to what appears in the Result Set.



Example...

  SELECT title, price, price * 1.05
  FROM book;


This shows the title and price information for all rows.

It also shows what the price of the books would be
if you raised their price by 5%.

Notice that I can use the <b>price</b> column in more that
one place in the SELECT list.

<hr>
You can use the standard mathematical operators:

	+  	Addition
	-	Subtraction
	*	Multiplication
	/	Division

There are more operators, but these will do for now.

Note: You can use ( )'s the same way you do in math.
e.g.  (7 + 5) * 8


<hr>

Let's look at another example...

  SELECT title, price * ytd_sales
  FROM book;


Here you see all the book titles and the total
amount of revenue that each book has made year-to-date.
(e.g.  revenue = price * ytd_sales)


<hr>
You can make it more obvious in the Result Set
headings that Revenue is being shown.

If you specify some double-quoted text after a column
name (but within the same comma-set) it will
appear as the heading in the Result set.


Example...

  SELECT title, price * ytd_sales "Revenue"
  FROM book;

<hr>

Let's look at another example using Text...

  SELECT 'Publisher: ', name, ' is based in ', city, state
  FROM publisher;
