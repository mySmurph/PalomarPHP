Comparison Operators
</p>

<pre class="lpre">
Comparisons between columns and values are made
in the WHERE clause.

The comparisons are used to restrict rows from the
results.

If a comparison is evaluated to be true (e.g.
price > 20) the row is returned to the results,
otherwise it is ignored.

<hr>

There are multiple operators that can be used for
comparison:

  =	equality
  >	greater than
  <	less than
  >=	greater than or equal
  <=	less than or equal
  <>	not equal
  !=	not equal


These are the most common, but you will learn
more as the class proceeds.

<hr>
Here are some examples:

  SELECT lastname, firstname, state
  FROM author
  WHERE state != 'CA'
  ORDER BY lastname, firstname;


  SELECT title, pubdate
  FROM book
  WHERE pubdate = '2012-06-15'
  ORDER BY title;


SELECT title, price
FROM book
WHERE price >= 17
ORDER BY title;
