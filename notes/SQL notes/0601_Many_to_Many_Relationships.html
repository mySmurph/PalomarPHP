Many-to-Many Relationships
</p>

<pre class="lpre">

This relationship between a <b>Primary Key</b> and a
<b>Foreign Key</b> is what is used to connect the data from
two tables.  The relationship it enforces is called
a <b>One-to-Many</b> relationship.

As you have seen, there are three publishers listed in
the <b>publisher</b> table.  For each publisher there are a
number of books in the <b>book table</b> connected to it
via the values of the pub_id column that resides in both
tables.

<hr>


Conceptually, this is a One-to-Many relationship because
"one" publisher can publish more than one ("many") books.

It is NOT true (in our database) that a "one" book can
be published by more than one ("many") publishers.

What kind of relationships would be classified as Many-to-Many?


<hr>

Let's look at the relationship between author and book.

Can an author write more than one book?

Can a book be written by more than one author?

The answer to both questions is yes.

The real question is:  How do we enforce this relationship
in the database?

<hr>

You might think that you could just carry an author_id
column in the book table and an ISBN number in the author
table... but that introduces big problems from a relational
database standpoint.

Using the above technique, here is an abbreviated data example
of an author who has written three books.

AuthorID 		ISBN		 SSN       	  	 Lastname  	FirstName
173    		1-1032-1032-x	 111-22-3333	  Smith		John
173    		1-1035-1035-x	 111-22-3333	  Smith		John
173    		1-2106-2106-x	 111-22-3333	  Smith		John

<hr>

In this "new" author table, I have to repeat the author's
AuthorID, SSN, Lastname, Firstname, etc. for every book
they have written.   That is a lot of data redundancy!

The goal is to repeat as little data as possible.

I will break this up into two separate tables, an <b>author</b>
table and a <b>bookauthor</b> table.

<hr>
AUTHOR
----------------
AuthorID-PK 	SSN       			Lastname  	  	FirstName
173    		111-22-3333	  	Smith			John

BOOKAUTHOR
---------------------
AuthorID-PK 		ISBN-PK
173    			1-1032-1032-x
173    			1-1035-1035-x
173    			1-2106-2106-x

This now allows me to put the author information
(ssn, lastname, etc.) in just one table.  If I need to
see how many books the author has written I can join the two
tables on the author_id column and count the rows.

<hr>
AUTHOR
----------------
AuthorID-PK 	SSN       			Lastname  	  	FirstName
173    		111-22-3333	  	Smith			John
190    		222-33-4444	  	Jones			Mary

BOOKAUTHOR
---------------------
AuthorID-PK-FK 		ISBN-PK-FK
173    				1-1032-1032-x
173    				1-1035-1035-x
190    				1-2106-2106-x

BOOK
------
ISBN-PK			Title					Price
1-1032-1032-x		One Hour Negotiations	29.99
1-1035-1035-x		Usability Testing		42.95
1-2106-2106-x		Instilling Courage		17.00
<hr>

So, to take the conceptual many-to-many relationship
between authors and books you have to invent a brand
new table.   This is called an "Intersection" table.

For this to work, the Primary Key of the Intersection table
must be a combination of the Primary Keys from the
tables you are connecting.

The <b>author</b> table has a Primary Key of author_id
and the <b>book</b> table has a Primary Key of ISBN.  So
the Primary Key of the Intersection table <b>must</b> be the
combination of the Author_id and the ISBN.

<hr>

But wait there's more!

Now that we are implementing the relationship between the
<b>book</b> table and <b>author</b> table with a <b>bookauthor</b> table
you can discover new attributes that only make sense to be
on the <b>bookauthor</b> table.

For example, if I wrote a book with Bill Gates whose name do you
think would be listed first?   Bill Gates would be in position #1
and I would be position #2.

Would I always be in position #2?   Not if I write a book by
myself.  Then, clearly, I am in position #1.

<hr>
The "author position" information may be different for an author
for each book they write, so it is an attribute of the author-book
relationship and must appear on the <b>bookauthor</b> table.

Likewise, I write a book with Bill Gates the monetary split is
probably not going to be 50-50.  Bill Gates gets 95% and I get 5%.
So, "royalty share" may be different for an author
for each book they write, so it is an attribute of the author-book
relationship and must appear on the <b>bookauthor</b> table.

Look at the database diagram.
