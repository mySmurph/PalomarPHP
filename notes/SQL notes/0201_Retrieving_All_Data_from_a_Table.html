Retrieving All Data from a Table
</p>

<pre class="lpre">
The SELECT statement is the <b>only</b> statement used to query data
on a relational database.

The SELECT statement has many, many options.

The most basic option is the ' * ' selector which
will show you the data for all the columns and
all the rows in a table.

Example...

  SELECT *
  FROM book;


This shows ALL the data <em>currently</em> stored in the <b>book</b> table.

I say <em>currently</em> because, in the real world, data changes
all the time.  If you worked for a large publishing company and
you ran this statement three times in the same hour, you might
get three different results.

The correctness of a SQL query is determined by "Did it ask
the right question?" not "Are data results always the same?"

A relational database allows multiple users to make updates
to the data from any location in the world where you can
make a connection to the database.

<hr>

In this class, of course, no one will be updating the data
but you.  That said, you should <b>always</b> code your statements
assuming that the data could change at any moment!

Don't ever code a SELECT statement that could only work
correctly if the data never changed.

<hr>

Let's look at another example...

  SELECT *
  FROM publisher;


Here you see all the data from the <b>publisher</b> table.
There are less results, than with the <b>book</b> table
because there are less rows and less columns in the
<b>publisher</b> table.
