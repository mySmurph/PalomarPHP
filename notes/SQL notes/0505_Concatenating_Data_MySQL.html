Concatenating Data
</p>

<pre class="lpre">
Concatenate means to link things together in a series.

With MySQL, there is a way to place more than one piece
of information together in a Result Set Column.

You may recall in Chapter 2, there was an example like this...

  SELECT 'Publisher: ', name, ' is based in ', city, state
  FROM publisher;

This showed five columns of the Results for all rows in the
publisher table.

What if you wanted to see all of this information display
in a single column?

<hr>

MySQL requires you to use a special CONCAT function to append information
together in a single colum, by using comma separate values.

So the SELECT statement can be rewritten like this...

  SELECT CONCAT('Publisher: ', name, ' is based in ', city , ', ' , state)
  FROM publisher;


NOTE:  I added an extra ', ' between city and state to improve
the formatting.




<hr>

This will work with aggregate functions, as well...

  SELECT CONCAT('Average price is: ',  AVG(price))
  FROM book;
