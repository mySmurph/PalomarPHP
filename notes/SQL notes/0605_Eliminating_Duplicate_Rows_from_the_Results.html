Eliminating Duplicate Rows from the Results
</p>

<pre class="lpre">
When joining two or more tables together, you can see duplicate
information repeated in the Result Set.

For example, if I wanted to know all the different states that
authors lived in I could do this...

	SELECT state, lastname, firstname
	FROM author
	ORDER BY 1, 2 ,3;

Since it is a small amount of data, I could just count them up.   If
you were dealing with a table that had thousands of authors, however,
that wouldn't be a good way to do it.

Since I really just wanted to see states,  I could change the
statement to...

	SELECT state
	FROM author
	ORDER BY 1;

Again, not very practical.

Fortunately, SQL provides a way to eliminate duplicate rows from the
Result Set by using the keyword DISTINCT just after the word SELECT...

	SELECT DISTINCT state
	FROM author
	ORDER BY 1;



<hr>


 You can even COUNT them instead...

 	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT state)
 	FROM author
	ORDER BY 1;

 Remember, unless the DISTINCT is inside of an aggregate function it
 will apply to all the columns in the Result Set.  You can not restrict to
 a subset of columns.


<hr>

These two statements give you very different results...

	SELECT DISTINCT price
	FROM book
	ORDER BY 1;

	SELECT DISTINCT price, advance
	FROM book
	ORDER  BY 1, 2;

... the 2nd statement does not show you the distinct prices
It shows you the distinct price-advance combinations
