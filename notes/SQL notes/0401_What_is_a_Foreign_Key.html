What is a Foreign Key?
</p>

<pre class="lpre">

You know that a <b>Primary Key</b> is a column, or combination
of columns, that is used to ensure the uniqueness of a
row in a table.

A <b>Foreign Key</b> is a column, or combination of columns,
in one table that refers back to the <b>Primary Key</b>
of another table.

This relationship between a <b>Primary Key</b> and a <b>Foreign Key</b>
is what is used to connect the data from two tables.


<hr>

How do you know which books (in the <b>book</b> table) that
a particular publishing company (in the <b>publisher</b> table)
have published?

Look at the Database Diagram.

See that there is a <b>pub_id</b> column that is the Primary
Key of the publisher table.  There is also a <b>pub_id</b> column,
in the book table that is a Foreign Key to the publisher table.

<hr>

There is a publisher, in the publisher table, that has
a name of "All Techo Books" and it has a pub_id whose
value is 1.

Select all the data in the book table.  Now look at the
pub_id column and you can see that there are six books
that have a pub_id value of 1.   These are the books
that are published by the "All Techo Books" publisher,
since it has a pub_id of 1.

The Foreign Key values in the book table get <b>joined</b>
with matching Primary Key values in the publisher table.

<hr>
A relational database is designed in such a way to reduce
the redundancy of data stored in the database.  This
necessitates breaking up data into separate tables in
such as way that may not be obvious.

Most of time, questions asked of the database (i.e. queries)
will need to be answered using data from more than one
table.  This is done through a process known as <b>Joining</b>.

Knowing how to <b>Join</b> the data between tables is
absolutely necessary in order to be able to effectively
use the data in most databases!
