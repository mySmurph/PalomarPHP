The Count Functions
</p>

<pre class="lpre">
There are two functions that count rows...

  COUNT(column_name)		- Returns a count of all rows that have a
  						  non-null value in the column-name

  COUNT(*)				- Returns a count of all rows in
  						  the Result Set


<hr>
When you use COUNT(column_name), any row that has a NULL value
in the column is not counted.

For example, there is one row in the 17-row book table that
has a NULL value in the advance column.

If you do this...

  SELECT COUNT(advance)
  FROM book;

... you will see one row and one column returned indicating
that the count of rows is 16.   The one row with the NULL
advance was ignored.

<hr>
When you use COUNT(*), NULLs are not an issue since the COUNT(*)
is not "looking" at any values in any columns.

Instead the COUNT(*) simply tells you how many rows were
returned by the statement.

Example...

  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM book;

... shows one row and one column returned indicating
that the count of rows is 17, because there are 17 rows
in the table.

<hr>

Here is an example using a WHERE clause...

  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM author
  WHERE lastname = 'Singer';

This shows one row and one column returned indicating
that the count of rows is 2, because there are 2 rows
in the author table with a lastname of 'Singer'

<hr>

When you look at all the rows of a table using an aggregate
function, you always get exactly one row returned.  However,
you may issue more than one summary function in a SELECT
statement... which will give you multiple columns returned.

Example...

  SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(advance)
  FROM book;

This shows one row and TWO columns returned indicating
that the count of all rows is 17 and the count of non-null
advances is 16.

<hr>
Remember that you can still JOIN tables.

This statements brings back two rows...

  SELECT name, lastname, firstname, city
  FROM publisher JOIN author USING (city);


If you just needed the count, you could do this...

  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM publisher JOIN author USING (city);
